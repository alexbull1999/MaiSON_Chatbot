    "summary": "MaiSON-AI was founded with a simple idea: the traditional estate agent model is outdated, expensive, and often doesn't serve buyers or sellers effectively. By leveraging cutting-edge AI technology, we've created a platform that handles all the functions of traditional estate agents at a fraction of the cost, while providing a superior experience for all parties involved.",
