# Your rule content

I am working on building a startup called MaiSON-AI, it's aim is to replace Estate Agents to improve the house buying/selling process, and to save house sellers money in commission. 


This is the general idea:
- Our AI agent will act as an intermediary facilitating the house viewing process, submissions of offers, offer negotiation  
- Once an offer has been accepted, our agent will guide seller and buyer through the next step, listing tasks for each party to complete (e.g. securing preliminary mortgage offer, conducting homebuyers survey, instructing solicitors)
- Removes the need to rely upon Estate Agents who are often unavailable, and are split between many different houses at the same time
- Estate agents charge between 1-3.5% commission on house sales on average; with this platform we can improve the house selling/buying experience, whilst saving seller money by only charging 0.5%

I am  building out the architecture for the Chatbot microservice of MaiSON-AI. Other developers are building out other microservices and the frontend. 

I want to build the Chatbot in python, using a Docker container to create an image that will be deployed. It will have an API endpoint that will be queried by other parts of the website when the chatbot is being used. The microservice needs to have its own database, recording message history with the chatbot. 

There are several possible ways that a user might chat with the chatbot. 
This is from the perspective of a buyer, but each functionality could be mirrored for a seller user:
1) General enquiries, e.g. the buyer asking the chatbot for area recommendations, or for how much to expect a certain type of property would cost

2) Enquiries about a specific property that are not intended as direct message to the seller of that property. E.g., asking the chatbot for advice on how much money to offer for a certain property.

3) Specific messages that the chatbot should relay from buyer to seller as an intermediary. E.g., the buyer asking the seller for specific property details/questions. The buyer submitting an offer for the house... etc. 

For option 3), there will be a specific front end app route that these messages will come from. 

For options 1 & 2, the chatbot will need to differentiate between the users request
